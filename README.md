# HoldTheGravity--Game
Youtube Demonstration : https://youtu.be/AWL4dikCoVk

I made this Game to participate in a Toy hackathon 2020 organised by NIT AP .

This was just a fun game which i made using some simple components lying around.

I have written the code using Multiple tabs so that it is easy to understand the overall flow. The Explaination is done in the youtube video.
